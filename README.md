# HyperList

## Description

"HyperList" is a complete React front-end client for a classified ads platform. It includes all the essential features - add, edit, delete, mark as favorite and also exchange messages with other users. It also includes login and register functionalities. "HyperList" is our mid-term project in an intense 3-months bootcamp on JavaScript. The REST-API back-end has been provided for us. This project is the sequel of the former project "SuperList" ([here](https://github.com/RyanLinXiang/superlist)).
